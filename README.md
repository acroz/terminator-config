# terminator Configuration

This is a [https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick](homesick)
castle for my configuration of terminator, an advanced terminal
emulator.

This configuration includes:

* Default to `zsh` as the shell
* Terminal colours matching editor configurations
* Config and key mapping for drop-down 'quake' style terminal
